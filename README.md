#Freelancing Sample - Debt Repayment Calculator, React + ES6 Version

This is a sample of work by Jacob Daniel Cramer, owner of Freelance Dragon, LLC, and also known by the usernames DracoAdvigilat and DracoAdvi. It's intended to show my skills with the **JavaScript** language when developing for a browser environment. While I've prettied things up with a bit of CSS, the focus is on the JavaScript components.

This particular variation is built using **React** and **Redux** in an **ES6** (aka ES2015) environment. **Webpack** has been used as the bundler of choice for this particular project, with **npm** as the package manager. **ESLint** has been used to help ensure consistency and aid in development.

For convenience, this repo has been pushed with a pre-built version included, allowing you to view the page as is without needing to install the development environment.

I'm releasing this code freely under the **MIT license**. If you're not familiar with the license, it's a short, simple, highly permissive license that lets you do nearly anything you want.
